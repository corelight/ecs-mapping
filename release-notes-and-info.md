### 2021.05
 - rdp.log
    add new fields from v21
    - auth_success > rdp.auth_success
      - add
        - if true = event.outcome:success
        - if false = event.outcome:failure
      - rdp.auth_success
    - channels_joined > rdp.channels_joined
    - inferences > rdp.inferences
    - rdpeudp_uid > rdp.rdpeudp_uid
    - rdfp_string > rdp.rdfp_string
    - rdfp_hash > rdp.rdfp_hash
- [ ] event.ingested GET RID OF event.created ? or what is that being set as now/used for?

- [ ] supports ECS 1.9.0


### 2020.05
- supports ECS 1.5.0
- ECS TLS schema
- ECS VLAN schema
- added analyzed fields for faster searching
- supports open source Zeek now (in addition to already supporting Corelight)
- added the logic for ECS field dns.header_flags
- updated import script to support user/pass, HTTP or HTTPS, HTTPS verification on/off, and ability to specify CA certificate if using HTTPS
- fixed issues with Elasticsearch's default scripting of only 15 per minute
- source & destination IP Geo enrichment processor
- source & destination IP Geo ASN enrichment processor
- user_agent enrichment processor
- increased error checking and verbosity of information related to errors in the import script
- elasticsearch mappings
- x509 schema, from ECS 1.6 
- increased efficiency of the pipeline
- `related.ip` (for pivoting across IP addresses)
- `related.mac` (for pivoting across MAC addresses) 
- `related.id` (for pivoting across Zeek logs), use this to pivot off of the `uid` field and any other "id" fields that Zeek has in it's logs like `fuid` or `conn_uids` and so on...
- `related.domain` (for pivoting across Domains)
- NTP log
- MQTT_Connect log
- MQTT_Publish log
- MQTT_Subscribe log
- MQTT_POP3 log
- GQUIC logy
- no longer renaming fields unless specifically an ECS name to be mapped to (to reduce confusion, but more importantly to share queries/hunts with those who do NOT do a lot of transform/ETL pipelines)
- SMTP_Links log
- Conn_Long log
- HTTP2 log
- reporter log for open source Zeek
- stats log for open source Zeek
- `community_id` named to ECS `network.community_id`
- more efficient use of conn log detailed history, by using enrich processor
- include Corelight pipeline version in each document. This allows if there is a hot-fix/issue between versions, for scripts to use this field to figure out what version was used and thus implement the logic to fix the issue
- Added Corelight SSH stepping (stones) `stepping.log`
- Added Corelight Suricata `suricata_corelight.log`
- If a parser is not included for a log (ie: an unknown or brand new log), that log is sent to the elasticsearch index `temp-corelight-$logname` ex: (`temp-corelight-conn`)
- Parsing failures of logs, will be "caught" and stored in index with the naming convention of `parse-failures-$YYYY.DD.MM` ex: (`parse-failures-2020.05.01`)
- Metrics, Stats, and Capture Loss type logs are stored in index with the naming convention of `corelight-zeek-metrics-$YYYY.DD.MM` ex: (`corelight-zeek-metrics-2020.05.01`)
    - `namecache.log` fields no longer get renamed, and are now stored in `corelight-zeek-namecache`
    - `reporter.log` fields no longer get renamed, and are now stored in `corelight-zeek-reporter`
    - `stats.log` fields no longer get renamed, and are now stored in `corelight-zeek-stats`
    
```

#### Versioning of templates, schema, etc
ecs version gets stored as `ecs.version`
corelight version gets stored as `labels.corelight.ecs_version`
ECS version is the current release of ECS that Corelight ECS is based upon.
Corelight ECS version is based on that ECS release. and will add its itteration of this.
For example, if the ECS version is `1.5.0` and the first release of Corelight is matching this version, then Corelight ECS version is `1.5.0.1`
then any new updates matching `1.5.0` would increment the 4th number, so the next update would be `1.5.0.2` and so on
When a new release of ECS comes out say `1.5.0` then first release of Corelight ECS would be `1.5.0.1`

Elasticsearch template (file named `template_corelight`) version is the value of `labels.corelight.ecs_version` without the dots, so `1.5.0.1` would be `1501`
